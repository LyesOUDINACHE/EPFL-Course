    "# Data models and relational SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how Python and Pandas are excellent tools for manipulating data but if we want to store this data long term then a DataFrame is not the best solution. What we need is a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "After text files and spreadsheets, databases are perhaps the most common form of data storage that you will come across as a data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "So why are databases so important? One of their main advantages is that they can really handle data on a massive scale. Usually, this data is much larger than what can fit in the memory of a computer. So databases are made to work with data that is stored outside memory on a disc. A nice feature of databases is that the structure of the data is independent of the way that the data is stored on the disc. This means that we can change the way the data is stored without worrying about changing the actual programs that work with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now another main advantage of databases is that they allow very efficient and reliable storage and access to this data. This is due to the rigid structure of the data. A third property is that they are an extremely safe option for data storage due to their multiple built-in mechanisms that ensure the data will stay consistent regardless of external factors such as software or hardware failures. In fact, data stored in databases is intended to even outlive the programs that are run on it. One final advantage of databases is that multiple programs can operate on the same database since they have built-in concurrency systems that control how different users or applications can access the data."

    "#### The relational model\n",
    "\n",
    "ne of the oldest and most common models for a database is the relational model. This is the model that is used by the vast majority of commercial database systems. The main components of a relational database are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- relations (these are the tables)\n",
    "- attributes (these are the columns of the tables)\n",
    "- tuples (these are the rows of the tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use of the keys is to relate different relations of a database. Normally databases will have several relations in them. We can relate two relations of a database by linking their keys. There are three types of linking that we can perform\n",
    "\n",
    "- one-to-one each key of the first relation relates to only one (or no) tuples in the related table.\n",
    "- one-to-many each key of the first relation relates to none, one, or many tuples in the related table\n",
    "- many-to-many each record in both tables can relate to any number of tuples (or no tuples) in the other table."

    "#### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have set up a schema and loaded some data into the database we can start to query this data and modify it. This is done using specific high-level languages. The advantage of using these high-level languages is that we can write our queries in a simple and compact format without really worrying about the algorithms behind which implement these queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are many different choices for relational query languages. One of the most popular ones is SQL (pronounced \"sequel\" or \"ess-que-el\") which stands for Structured Query Language. It was first described in 1970 in Edgar F. Codds's 1970 paper \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\" and has been a standard for the American National Standards Institute since 1986. Since then it has become the language of choice for databases in most companies and commercial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of SQL is that it can be used with many different database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with databases in Python we must first choose a database system. There are many different systems available such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite to name a few. They each have their own advantages and can be used for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is what is known as an embedded or file-based database, while MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL are server-based databases. Essentially each type of database is trying to solve a different problem. Embedded databases are great for small-scale applications and they run locally on your PC rather than a remote server. Each database is stored as a single file on disk. This makes them a great choice if you want to optimize economy, efficiency, independence, and simplicity. **Server-based databases, on the other hand, are better for larger and more complex data where you are interested in scalability, concurrency, centralization and control**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this course, we will focus on SQLite since it makes a great choice for an introduction to SQL. In addition, SQLite is already built into Python and we can use a special library to access the SQLite databases called sqlite3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we will look at exploring our first database with some simple SQL queries. The database that we will work with is the SF Bay Area Bike Share from Kaggle. You can download the 'database.sqlite' file from the resources tab of this unit or the link\n",

Again we will have to work with the two tables trip and station but this time we are interested in obtaining the city of both the start station and the end station. This means that we need to join the trip table to the station table twice: the first for matching up trip.start_station_name with station.name and the second for matching up trip.end_station_name with station_name. To distinguish between the two views of the station table we will give each an alias name"

And if the file is large then this can cause serious problems. In such instances, it is better to load the file as a database which is stored on the disk but is still easy and fast to interact with.\n",
