    "First, k-NN doesn't learn parameters from the training set. Its k value is a **hyperparameter set before fitting the algorithm**. Hence, it doesn't use an optimizer like gradient descent. However, we need to be careful about the features scale because it uses a distance metric to find the nearest neighbors. Let's take an example with the human heights and weights data set.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In this example, the weight variable has a much larger scale than height. For this reason, we need to be careful: k-nearest neighbors searches for points with similar values. Since the weight values are more spread out, k-NN will favor points with similar weight values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this issue, here is an image with the 100 nearest points to the average person with weight=127 and height=68\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, k-NN selects points with similar weight values and the orange circle spans most of the data on the y-axis: the height variable has nearly no impact on the nearest neighbors search.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that standardizing the data doesn't modify the information content: we can still observe the relationship between height and weight i.e. taller people weigh more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the 100 points from the previous experiment in orange now form an ellipse with the weight variable as the minor axis. This reveals the bias of k-NN toward similar weight values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to apply standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we standardize the input data for two reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some **optimization algorithms** work better when the features are standardized ex. gradient descent\n",
    "- Some algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the features because they use a **distance metric** ex. k-NN\n",
    "- With **regularization** which expects features to be on the same scale\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, it's a good idea to standardize the features when using k-NN to avoid having a model that is biased toward features that have a larger scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "However we need to remember that by standardizing the data we transform the feature space and in some cases this transformation might produce undesired results. For instance, in the first example that we saw with the house prices from the \"K-nearest neighbors\" introductory unit, each data point is represented by its location on a longitude/latitude grid. But the data points (the houses) might be more spread out along the longitude or the latitude axis. (Long Beach (NY, USA) or the African state The Gambia are examples of this.) So in this case, we don't want to rescale these two features individually, but with the same scaler. In other scenarios features may be representing different prices or the time intervals measured by different sensors. It depends on the particular context and our judgement whether we think that the relative relationship of these feature values is important and standardising them risks distortion when using k-NN. In any case, it's a good idea to try with and without standardization to see what works best.\n",
