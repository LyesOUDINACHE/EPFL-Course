    "As a part of the International Supply Chain department in Jaeger-LeCoultre (Watchmaking industry) as a Senior Business Analyst, I make tools to support the operational team to dispatch the watches all over the world on one hand, and to make proper sales forecasts on the other hand in order to have the right watch at the right place.\n",
