    "# Logistic Regressions \n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification setting, we have a \"positive\" and a \"negative\" class, and we want to build a classifier that detects positive entries. One way to achieve this is to use numerical values to encode the two categories and fit a linear regression. For instance, we can encode negative entries with a 0 and positive ones with a 1 and then predict the positive class if our linear regression predicts a value above 0.5.\n",

    "The idea is a bit similar in logistic regressions. Instead of using a threshold, we convert the output of the linear regression model into probabilities using the logistic function, also **called sigmoid function**\n",
